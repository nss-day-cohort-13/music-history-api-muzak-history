This is the final group project for NSS Cohort 13 prior to starting our second capstone and participate in Demo Day. *Music History* is a project we've worked with in various iterations since we first started our program in April, and it's fitting that we end the program with the same app we started with.

This final version of *Music History* is a RESTful Django app, focusing on demonstrating our ability to load from and write to an API using Django. The MVP of this project includes:

- Defining the relationships between Artist, Track, and Album
- Using those relationships to build tables in a database
- Load relevant information from the database
- Write new information to the database

We were given 24 hours to complete this final chapter of Music History and present our finished product to the class.
